I used the lyrics dataset for two purposes.
1. First, to train song genre classifiers.
2. Second,to test the performance of the classifiers.
I then used the K Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm to decides whether that attribute belongs to hip-hop or country based on its similarity to previously seen examples.
